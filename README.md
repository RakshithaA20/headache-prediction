Headache Classification Using Gaussian Naive Bayes

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify different types of headaches based on patient symptoms and medical history. The dataset contains various features related to headaches, such as age, duration, severity, location, and associated symptoms. The objective is to predict the type of headache a patient is experiencing (e.g., migraine, tension, cluster, etc.) using a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier.

Key Features of the Project:
Data Preprocessing: Categorical features were converted to numerical values to make the data suitable for model training.
Model Training: The Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm was used due to its simplicity and efficiency in handling classification tasks, especially with categorical data.
Model Evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated using a confusion matrix and accuracy score, providing insights into its classification ability.

Project Structure:
Dataset: Contains patient information and headache-related features.
Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning and feature transformation.
Modeling: Implementation of the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier.
Evaluation: Performance metrics and confusion matrix analysis.

Future Work:
Model Optimization: Experimenting with different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter tuning.
Feature Engineering: Adding or modifying features to improve model accuracy.
Visualization: Enhancing data visualization for better insights into the dataset.
